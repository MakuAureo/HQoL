# HQoL

Collection of QoL changes meant to improve the High Quota experience by saving time and performance w/o giving any advantages.

# Changes
## Auto item storage + sell module
The main change in this mod, at the end of every quota all your scrap, except shotguns and knives (configurable), will be stored avoiding the 
insane lag from the 2k+ items you can collect over a v73 run. It also has it's own sell module that can find the correct combination of items 
**very** fast even with tons of items.

### Utility commands
#### Sell \[value\] (-o)
Finds the best match for `value`. You can also account for overtime by typing -o after the value.

#### Deposit \[item name\]
Finds all the items that best match `item name` to store.

#### Check
Displays all the currently stored items.

#### Overtime
Displays how much overtime will be earned after the current quota is fulfilled.

## Faster company dropship
Dropship takes 6s after you buy any item or cruiser to come down (resets if you buy another items). The landing speed is also faster.

## Mute speaker
Day 1 speaker is mute.

## Auto item sorter
When you reload a save file all items will be teleported inside to designated spots.
Shotgun and Weed Killer will be sorted by how full they are.
